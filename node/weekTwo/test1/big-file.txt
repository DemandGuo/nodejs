Node.js File System and Async Operations
=====================================

Node.js provides a powerful module called 'fs' (File System) for interacting with the file system. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations. Asynchronous methods are non-blocking and use callbacks or Promises, making them ideal for high-performance applications.

The fs.promises API allows developers to use async/await syntax, which improves code readability. For example:

  const data = await fs.promises.readFile('example.txt', 'utf-8');

This line reads the entire content of 'example.txt' as a string. If the file does not exist, an error will be thrown unless handled properly.

When working with large files, it's important to consider memory usage. Reading a huge file into memory all at once can cause performance issues. In such cases, streaming is recommended.

Chinese Paragraphs (中文测试内容)
=====================================

在软件开发过程中，调试是一项至关重要的技能。许多开发者花费大量时间定位问题根源，而有效的调试策略能显著提升效率。常见的调试方法包括使用断点、打印日志、单元测试和代码审查。

Node.js 是一个基于 Chrome V8 引擎的 JavaScript 运行时环境，广泛用于构建高性能的网络应用。其事件驱动、非阻塞 I/O 模型使其特别适合数据密集型实时应用。

日志分析是运维工作的核心环节之一。通过分析服务器日志，我们可以监控用户行为、检测异常、优化性能。关键词如 "error"、"timeout"、"login" 经常出现在日志排查中。

在日常开发中，我们经常需要搜索特定关键词。例如，查找所有包含 "123" 的记录，可能用于追踪测试数据或验证系统行为。本文件特意加入了多处 "123" 以便测试搜索功能。

=====================================
Numbers, Special Characters, and Repeated Keywords
=====================================

User ID: 123, Order Number: 456789, Transaction ID: TXN-987654321
Phone: +1-800-555-0123, ZIP Code: 12345, PIN: ****123
Error Code: E123, Status: 200 OK, Retry Count: 3, Delay: 123ms
Password hint: contains digits like 1, 2, 3 in sequence

Search keywords test: 123 appears multiple times here -> 123 123 123
Another line with number: The value is 123 and should be found.
Special chars: @#$%^&*()_+{}|:"<>?[]\\;',./`~ 123 done.

=====================================
End of File
=====================================

This file is intentionally large and repetitive to simulate real-world log or document scenarios.
It includes keywords such as: Node.js, fs, readFile, 123, error, login, user_id, etc.
You can use this file to test your CLI tool's ability to search across large texts efficiently.
