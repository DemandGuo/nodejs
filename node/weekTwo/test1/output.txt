NODE.JS FILE SYSTEM AND ASYNC OPERATIONS
=====================================

NODE.JS PROVIDES A POWERFUL MODULE CALLED 'FS' (FILE SYSTEM) FOR INTERACTING WITH THE FILE SYSTEM. IT SUPPORTS BOTH SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS OPERATIONS. ASYNCHRONOUS METHODS ARE NON-BLOCKING AND USE CALLBACKS OR PROMISES, MAKING THEM IDEAL FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE APPLICATIONS.

THE FS.PROMISES API ALLOWS DEVELOPERS TO USE ASYNC/AWAIT SYNTAX, WHICH IMPROVES CODE READABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE:

  CONST DATA = AWAIT FS.PROMISES.READFILE('EXAMPLE.TXT', 'UTF-8');

THIS LINE READS THE ENTIRE CONTENT OF 'EXAMPLE.TXT' AS A STRING. IF THE FILE DOES NOT EXIST, AN ERROR WILL BE THROWN UNLESS HANDLED PROPERLY.

WHEN WORKING WITH LARGE FILES, IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER MEMORY USAGE. READING A HUGE FILE INTO MEMORY ALL AT ONCE CAN CAUSE PERFORMANCE ISSUES. IN SUCH CASES, STREAMING IS RECOMMENDED.

CHINESE PARAGRAPHS (中文测试内容)
=====================================

在软件开发过程中，调试是一项至关重要的技能。许多开发者花费大量时间定位问题根源，而有效的调试策略能显著提升效率。常见的调试方法包括使用断点、打印日志、单元测试和代码审查。

NODE.JS 是一个基于 CHROME V8 引擎的 JAVASCRIPT 运行时环境，广泛用于构建高性能的网络应用。其事件驱动、非阻塞 I/O 模型使其特别适合数据密集型实时应用。

日志分析是运维工作的核心环节之一。通过分析服务器日志，我们可以监控用户行为、检测异常、优化性能。关键词如 "ERROR"、"TIMEOUT"、"LOGIN" 经常出现在日志排查中。

在日常开发中，我们经常需要搜索特定关键词。例如，查找所有包含 "123" 的记录，可能用于追踪测试数据或验证系统行为。本文件特意加入了多处 "123" 以便测试搜索功能。
